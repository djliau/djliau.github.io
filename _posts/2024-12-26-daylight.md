Can screens be designed to act more like paper?

## Healthier Devices

A few device companies have begun to address the artificial light problems in hardware design:

1. [Daylight](https://daylightcomputer.com/product)
2. [HannsNote2](https://www.hannspree.com/product/hannsnote2)
3. [eyemoo Epaper S1](https://eyemootech.com/products/eyemoo-s1-rlcd-tablet?variant=45128544420118)

## Designed for Humans

By using RLCD technology, these devices aim to reduce blue-light exposure and light flicker, and the associated mental and physiological issues.

The Daylight computer also includes a customized Android-based operating system (OS) that is designed for a distraction-free experience.

## Thoughts

These devices provide a good alternative especially for educational use. However, the accessibility of these devices is very limited.

Even with a less distracting OS, individual applications need additional design considerations, and users need education around device usage for an optimal outcome.

Putting human well-being at the forefront is essential and will become even more important when feeding data to artificial intelligences.
