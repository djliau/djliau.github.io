The following recommendations are based on the findings in my research. 

## For Educators | [PDF](/files/edapp_edu.pdf)


* Select applications with mental health in mind.
	* Vet applications for gamification, privacy and usability. 
	* Monitor gamification and adjust to student needs.
* Remind students to take breaks (movement breaks, and eye exercises).
* Encourage use of blue light blocking glasses.
* Foster in-person connections.
* Normalize mental health discussion.


## For Application Designers | [PDF](/files/edapp_dev.pdf)


* Remember the human (put user well-being first).
* Respect user's privacy.
* Include customization of colours and other aesthetics.
* Enable educator and parental controls.
* Use "opt-in" rather than "opt-out" for notifications, with frequency preferences.
* Consider blue light exposure and repetitive strain.
	* Include options for break and health reminders rather than disclaimers.
	* Included off-screen activities.
